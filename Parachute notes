Best materials for parachute:
- Nylon wires
- rip stop fabric
- Silk

How to test parachute:
- Tie it to an egg, and if the egg does not break it is good. 

String attachment to parachute:
- Make a small hole
- Tie the string in the hole

Equations:
- To calculate the area of parachute required to give a descent velocity:
    - A = (2mg)/(Cdpv^2)
      - Cd = drag coefficient â‰ˆ 1.75 (The higher drag coefficient produces a lower terminal velocity)
      - p = density
      - mg = drag force
      - v = velocity'
      - A = cross sectional area
